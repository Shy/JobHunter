We like generalists, but by no means require a unicorn. We prefer T-shaped expertise—with depth in one area and broad interest in developing other areas.\n\nThe most important characteristic we look for is that you’re able to figure out what should be done and get it done—this requires thoughtfulness with a bias towards taking action and assuming responsibility. This is absolutely crucial in a small startup team, and for this reason, we prefer that you already have demonstrated this experience working in a prior startup.\n\n\n Modeled off of startup accelerators and incubators, Defy’s intensive 6-month program provides carefully selected, ambitious men and women with criminal histories entrepreneurship, leadership and employee development to help them become successful businessman, employers, parents and community leaders\n\n\n\n",
